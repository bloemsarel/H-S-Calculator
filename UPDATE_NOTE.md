## Important Clinical Note

### Holliday-Segar Formula Applicability:

✅ **Most Accurate For:**
- Neonates
- Infants
- Children
- Adolescents
- Adults up to approximately 70 kg

⚠️ **Adults >70 kg:**
- The formula still calculates, but may underestimate needs
- Clinical judgment is essential
- Consider alternative fluid calculation methods
- Monitor patient response closely
- Adjust based on clinical condition

---

## Formula Remains Unchanged

The actual calculation method is **exactly the same**:
- **0-10 kg**: 100 mL/kg/day
- **11-20 kg**: 1000 mL + 50 mL/kg for each kg above 10
- **>20 kg**: 1500 mL + 20 mL/kg for each kg above 20

This is the standard Holliday-Segar method that has always been used for all ages, with clinical judgment applied based on patient characteristics.

## Why This Matters

### Original Problem:
- "Pediatric" in the title was misleading
- Made users think it couldn't be used for adults
- Limited perceived applicability

### Solution:
- Clarified it works for all ages
- Added appropriate clinical guidance
- Maintained medical accuracy
- Enhanced user confidence

## Medical Accuracy

The Holliday-Segar method is a **validated approach** for estimating maintenance fluid requirements that:
- Was originally developed for pediatric patients
- Is commonly used across all age groups
- Requires clinical judgment for special populations
- Should be adjusted based on patient factors

### Clinical Considerations for All Ages:

**Neonates & Infants:**
- May need adjustments in first days of life
- Consider insensible losses
- Monitor carefully

**Children & Adolescents:**
- Formula works very well
- Standard of care in many institutions

**Adults (especially >70 kg):**
- Use as starting point
- Consider comorbidities
- Adjust based on clinical response
- Alternative methods may be preferred in some cases

## No Functional Changes

✅ **The calculator works exactly the same way**
✅ **All calculations are identical**
✅ **User interface unchanged**
✅ **Features remain the same**

**Only the description was clarified to reflect actual clinical usage.**
